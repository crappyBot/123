This programming task consists of building a simple web application to search for flights. Create a new local branch to implement a simple flight search application. It should take this input from the user:

(Flight Number || (Origin && Destination)) && Date

The application will call a service that you create in ExpressJS. Use Couchbase as the data source. You can download the docker image of Couchase and run it locally.

Create a new bucket and add the documents included in project.

Flight Documents

The file contains an array. Make a document out of each array element. You can you use any value you want as the document key. Create a N1QL statement update the date component of the arrrival and departure properties of each document. This will allow you to specify a current date when searching.

• Validate that the user has provided the right criteria to make a search 
• Neatly display the results
